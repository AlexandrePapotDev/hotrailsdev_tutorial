# Quote Editor with Rails 7 and Hotwire

This repository contains the source code of the quote editor application that I built following the [hotrails.dev tutorial](https://www.hotrails.dev/turbo-rails). The tutorial teaches you how to use [Hotwire](https://hotwire.dev/) and [Turbo](https://turbo.hotwire.dev/) with [Ruby on Rails 7](https://rubyonrails.org/) to create modern, single-page, reactive web applications without writing any custom JavaScript code.

## What is Hotwire and Turbo?

Hotwire is a frontend framework that consists of two libraries: Stimulus and Turbo. Stimulus is a modest JavaScript framework for adding interactivity to HTML elements. Turbo is a library that makes web pages faster, more interactive and more responsive by making all link clicks and form submissions AJAX requests, slicing web pages into independent pieces that can be loaded or updated separately, and enabling real-time updates with ActionCable.

## What will you learn from the tutorial?

The tutorial covers many topics and concepts related to web development with Rails 7 and Hotwire, such as:

- How to set up a Rails 7 application
- How to create a nice design system
- How to use Turbo Drive, Turbo Frames and Turbo Streams
- How to handle flash messages and empty states with Hotwire
- How to test your code with Capybara and Minitest
- And much more!

The tutorial is based on a real-world project and covers many common challenges and best practices for developing web applications with Rails and Hotwire.

## How to run the application?

To run the application locally, you will need:
